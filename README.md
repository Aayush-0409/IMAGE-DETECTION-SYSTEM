# 🖼️ Image Recognition Web App

This project is a **web-based image classification system** that allows users to upload an image and receive real-time predictions about what the image contains. It leverages **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight convolutional neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

---

## 📌 Features

✅ Upload an image via a simple web interface  
✅ Get top-1 predicted class label with confidence score  
✅ Based on a deep learning model trained on ImageNet (1,000 classes)  
✅ Built with **Flask**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, and **Bootstrap**

## 📸 About Image Recognition

Image recognition (or image classification) is a core computer vision task where a model predicts the class of the object(s) present in an image. By training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on large datasets like **ImageNet**, we enable the model to identify thousands of object categories.

This project uses **MobileNetV2**, an efficient CNN architecture designed for fast inference on CPUs and mobile devices, making it perfect for lightweight deployments.
